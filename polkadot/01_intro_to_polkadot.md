## Introduction to Polkadot

### How do you make a blockchain secure, decentralized and scalable at the same time?

Every Network tries to solve this. Famous trilemma but Polkadot succeeds by anchoring many layer 1 block chains to a common layer zero security chain in a way connecting the dots to create a multi-core blockchain. It's not about a single core processing as fast as it can but about many specialized cores making light work of complex tasks in parallel in Polkadot. Decentralized applications can draw on the unique compute of these individual block chains called pair chains to make truly cross-chain applications and crucially these dots are connected under a single security blanket the blocks of all the pair chains and the data exchange between them is validated by the relay chain which removes those weak points of failure prevalent in other interchained communication systems. Polkadot was founded in 2016 by Gavin wood former ethereum CTO and creator of the solidity programming language for the ethereum virtual machine polkadot's Genesis block was produced in 2020 with pair chains rolling out a year later after first being tested on the Rococo test net then polka dots Canary Network called kusama polkadot's core features are shared security interoperability provided by a trustless messaging format scalability due to its heterogeneous parachain sharding design forkless runtime upgradability on-chain governance and treasury.
