Polkadot has a modular design coming from a blockchain building framework called **Substrate**. This development kit allows projects to build blockchains compatible with the entire network with as little overhead as possible. The Substrate framework makes this possible using **pallets** which are runtime customizable modules. This library of building blocks is constantly expanding and can be assembled to create any blockchain imaginable. Pallets can allow the deployment of solidity smart contracts but webassembly is also an option using ink. Rust-ink!-WASM **ink!** is a programming language designed specifically for writing smart contracts in Rust for substrate based blockchains. It was developed by parity technologies as a safer more expressive alternative to Solidity. While substrate framework allows both _EVM_ and _WASM_. WASM smart contract development is vital for the future of blockchain. EVM may be the go-to smart contract environment today, but it requires blockchain specific and high-level programming languages like Solidity. WASM allows developers to build with the language they're familiar with. This lowers the barrier of entry for developers and allows them to focus on the applications they want to build.
