## Relay Chain, Parachains, and Parathreads

Relay chains parachains parathreads and architecture the relay chain and shared security.

### Relay Chain
The heart of Polkadot, responsible for the network’s shared security, consensus and cross-chain interoperability.

### Parachains
Sovereign blockchains that can have their own tokens and optimize their functionality for specific use cases.

### Parathreads
Similar to parachains but with a pay-as-you-go model. More economical for blockchains that don’t need continuous connectivity to the network.
